# Declaration-in-C

In C programming, a declaration is a statement that introduces the name and data type of an identifier (such as a variable, function, or struct) that will be used in a program. Declarations specify the name and data type of the identifier, but do not necessarily allocate memory for it or define its behavior.

For variables, the declaration syntax is simply to specify the data type followed by the variable name. For example, the declaration int age; specifies that an integer variable named "age" will be used in the program. Similarly, float price; declares a float variable named "price".

Function declarations specify the return type, function name, and any parameters that the function accepts. For example, the declaration int sum(int a, int b); specifies that a function named "sum" will return an integer value and accept two integer parameters "a" and "b".

Declarations are essential in C because they allow the compiler to understand how the identifiers in the program will be used, and allocate the appropriate memory for them. They also help to catch errors in the program, such as misspelled variable names or incorrect function parameter types.
